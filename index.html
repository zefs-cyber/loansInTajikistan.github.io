    <h1>What is it?</h1>
    <p>
        This project aims to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for customers in Tajikistan who are
        seeking to make informed decisions about their financial options by offering a sophisticated platform that
        enables them to easily compare and evaluate the diverse range of loans available from different banks operating
        within the country. By leveraging advanced technology, data analysis, and intuitive interfaces, the project
        strives to empower individuals with the necessary tools and information to navigate the complex landscape of
        loan offerings, thereby facilitating financial literacy and enabling individuals to make optimal choices based
        on their unique needs and preferences.

    <h1>How to use?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Loan Search and Comparison: The project provides a comprehensive platform where users can search and compare
            various loan options available in Tajikistan. It offers an extensive database of loans from different banks,
            allowing users to explore and evaluate the terms, interest rates, repayment options, and eligibility
            criteria of each loan.
        </li>
        <li>Real-Time Exchange Rate Information: In addition to loan search functionality, the project also offers
            real-time exchange rate information. Users can access the latest exchange rates, enabling them to make
            informed decisions regarding loans and currency conversions. This feature adds value by providing up-to-date
            financial data for users considering loans with foreign currency components or planning international
            transactions.
        </li>
        <li>Bank Integration and Application Process: The project streamlines the loan application process by
            integrating with multiple banks in Tajikistan. Users can conveniently apply for loans directly through the
            platform, eliminating the need to visit individual bank websites or branches. The project simplifies the
            application procedure, allowing users to submit their loan applications electronically and track their
            progress.
